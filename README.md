# Task Manager on the SHell

## Description

TodoSH is a task manager command line interface. The CLI is built with:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org),
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/),
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)
- [CommanderJS](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#readme),
- [InquirerJS](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/blob/master/packages/inquirer/README.md),
- [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#readme),
- [Ora](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora#readme).

Its display is simple but colorful to help reading easily a long list of tasks. With TodoSH you can create tasks and subtasks and recursively. This means a subtask can hold a task and so forth. One of the key features of TodoSH is the ability to use one process to create a task followed by an intention to append as many subtasks as the user wants in a loop. The user can decide not to assign subtasks. In this case he is asked if he wants to create a new task.

A tasks should have a title, but the description is optional. Regarding the description, the default text editor of the operating system is opened for writing. This is a convenient way to more easily write a description in several lines. In additon, a text description is aligned left and indented when displayed on the terminal. For more informations take a look at the examples above or the help of a command.

## Examples

### Calling todo to display the help

```bash
Usage: todo [options] [command]

Your terminal task manager!

Options:
  -V, --version     output the version number
  -h, --help        display help for command

Commands:
  list [options]
  create [options]
  find
  update [options]
  delete            Deletes a task.
  help [command]    display help for command
```

### Listing all tasks and subtasks

This command displays all the tasks and subtasks without filters

```bash
todo list -a
```

### Create a task

To create a task, the user has three ways:

#### Creating only tasks

To create only tasks, execute one of the following commands

```bash
todo create -t
```

or

```bash
todo create --task

? Enter the title of the task: Test#0: adding a new task
? Describe what you want to do: Received
? Do you want to add more tasks? (Y/n) n

Successfully connected to database!!!
âœ” Tasks created successfully!
Disconnected from the database.
```

The user is asked to provide a task title (required) and a description (optional).

#### Creating only subtasks

To create only subtasks, execute one of the following commands

```bash
todo create -s
```

or

```bash
todo create --subtask

? Enter the code of the parent task: zmCCKKb4qU
Successfully connected to database!!!
Task found!

? Enter the title of the subtask: Test#1: adding a subtask
? Describe what you want to do: Received
? Do you want to add more subtasks? No

Successfully connected to database!!!
âœ” Subtasks created successfully!
Disconnected from the database.
```

One must provide a task code. To get it, display the tasks with **todo list -a** or **todo find**

#### Creating tasks and subtasks

To create only tasks, execute one of the following commands

```bash
todo create -w
```

or

```bash
todo create --tasks-with-subtasks

? Enter the title of the task: Test#2: adding a new task then its subtasks
? Describe what you want to do: Received
? Do you want to add a subtask? Yes
? Enter the title of the subtask: Test#3: adding a subtask immediately after its parent task creation
? Describe what you want to do: Received
? Do you want to add a subtask? No
? Do you want to add more tasks? No

Successfully connected to database!!!
Created the tasks!
Disconnected from the database.
```

A task creation is first performed then subtask creation and it can be repeated as much as desired

### Filtering tasks

Tasks are filtered by code, parent code, title and status. Filtering by title is the same as looking for tasks which titles contain the provided set of strings

```bash
FYI: You can skip a question by pressing Enter
? Filter by task code: 
? Filter by parent task code: 
? Fitler by task title: 
? Fitler by status None

Successfully connected to database!!!
Task Code: zmCCKKb4qU
Parent Task Code: undefined

### Deleting a task

To delete task, its code is asked.
**Warning:** Deleting a task deletes all its subtask and recursively!

```bash

```

### Updating a task

To update task, its code is should be provided. But there is two kinds of update:

#### Update a task

This operation updates the title, description and parent task code of a task.

```bash
todo update -t

The title and the description are updated.

```bash
